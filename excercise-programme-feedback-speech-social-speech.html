        <p>First of all I am thankful for this opportunity given to express my feedback on this exercise programme. </p>
<p>Let me introduce myself , my name is Ilyas. Many people from my locality and many of my relatives are present here. </p>
<p>Years ago, when I used to do morning walk on airport road I used to see people wearing jersey's written ‘Yoga club’.At that time I was wondering what type of Yoga these people are doing in the school ground nearby.  As months went by the number of people wearing the jersey increased and the name on the jersey was changed to MEC7. A month a go I was thinking about giving a shot at routine exercises,I came to the school ground and participated in mec7 programme. I have continuously attended the programme for a month now.</p>
<h4>What I like about the programme is</h4>
<ul>
<li>It Starts early in the morning. Starts on time and the duration of the programme is only 21 minutes.</li>
<li>All three types of major exercises are present in programme ie<ul>
<li>Light physical exercises like jumping jacks, situps etc</li>
<li>Stretching exercises </li>
<li>Breathing exercises</li>
<li>It can be done by children to seniors and I can see that seniors are the people who benefit more from this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changes I felt after attending for one month</h4>
<ul>
<li>I will be very calm throughout the day even on a stressful day.</li>
<li>Clarity and focus was improved.</li>
<li>Afternoon sleepiness went away.</li>
<li>I have heard feedback from others that symptoms of many lifestyle diseases like diabetes and hypertension were improved.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to some personal circumstances I discontinued the programme after one month, I am  thinking about joining back in full spirit.</p>
<p>I know that Mr.Salahudheen after retiring from the paramilitary designed MEC7(Multi Exercise Combination 7) which is such an innovative exercise programme. I have heard feedback from older people and young people how much effect the programme had on their routine lives.Thank you sir. </p>
<p>Thanks again everyone for giving me this opportunity to speak.</p>
