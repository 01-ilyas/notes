<h1>Closing Remarks</h1>
<p>Carl Jung quote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The greatest burden a child can have is the unlived life of a parent.” – Carl Jung. We often think our dreams are just ours to carry. But our kids sense the weight of the paths we didn't take, the passions we left behind. Living fully isn't only for us—it's a legacy we pass on"</p>
</blockquote>
